# Crystal Picker - Week 4 Game

This application was created for the fourth week homework assignment at the bootcamp I attended with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and jQuery. The assignment was to build a Crystal Picker game. The computer generates a random number and displays it on the screen. At the start of each round, each of the 4 crystals on the page will be assigned a random number between 1 and 12.  The object of the game is to make you score equal the random number that was generated at the start by clicking on the crystals. The values of the crystals will be added and will be displayed in the section titled: "Your Total Score Is". If your score and the random number match, you win. If your score goes over the random number's amount, you will lose.  Your wins and losses are recorded in the center of the board.
